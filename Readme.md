# Directory Check Script

This is a Python script that allows you to check if directories (and their subdirectories) contain any files. It will recursively explore each directory and report if they are empty or contain files. The results can be saved to a text file.

## Features

- Recursively checks directories for files.
- Reports if a directory is empty or contains files.
- Allows user input to specify the directory to check.
- Results can be saved to a text file of your choice.

## Installation

To use the script, simply clone this repository to your local machine:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSK010/Directory_Check.git
cd Directory_Check
```

Then, you can run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python3 dir_check.py
```

Usage

    Run the script using Python 3.
    Provide the path of the directory you want to check.
    Enter the directory where you want to save the results and the name of the file.
    The script will output whether each directory is empty or contains files and will save the results to a .txt file.
